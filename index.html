      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>Communication between Mars and Earth are currently through satellites. Currently, DSN(Deep Space Network), which is an “international array of giant radio antennas, plus a few that orbit Earth” from NASA is used [2]. Due to the long distance, there is a between 3 and 22 minutes delay based on the speed of light. The astronauts can also access a limited amount of websites that are downloaded from earth to the server on Mars. They can also transfer images back to earth.

The rovers can also automatically avoid obstacles. Autonomous navigation makes long distance travel easier since only step-by-step commands, instead of the entire path, need to be given.

      <h3>Ethics</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the film, because of the storm, commander Melissa Lewis was forced to decide to leave Mark Watney behind, and no one questioned that seems unethical decision. However, there are two concerns behind this decision. The first one is Mark Watney was detected as no vital sign from the Spacecraft. The other concern is that,  because of the approaching devastating storm, if the rest of crew stay there and wait for Mark, it may lead to losing more of the team.
<br><br>
        Besides, as for the most disputable topic in this movie, whether save Watney or not, is another question related to ethics. Spending hundreds billions dollars to save a single life seems not worth to a bunch of the public who hold the idea that the money spending on saving Watney can save a much larger number of person need help. However, bring an astronaut who is in dangerous situation back home have immeasurable value in not only ethical side but also financial side. We will discuss more details in the conclusion section.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Movie Maker Intent</h3>
      <p>
        The Martian is originally based off the book “The Martian: A Novel” by Andy Wier, published in 2011. The movie was adapted in 2015 by director Ridley Scott. The book was a fairly popular sci-fi novel noted as a “engineering manual to survive on Mars” [1]. Wier a previous computer programmer, and the son of a physicist and engineer enjoyed creating the science fiction novel. His idea for the novel came when contemplating how a manned mission to Mars would work and how they would return home [2]. He wanted to give a detailed explanation of the science behind interplanetary space travel and the challenges of reaching and surviving on a hostile, distant planet. When the movie was created Wier supplyed information on many of the technical aspects.
<br><br>
        Although movie adaptations cannot show everything in the book Scott’s narrative displays a realistic sci-fi film with a focus on human life and ingenuity. Front of mind in his film is the question of leaving a man behind, and the urgency of saving that person no matter the risk. Scott’s emphasis in the film was the importance and value of a single man’s life. This is most likely connected to Scott’s own journey after losing his brother to suicide a few years earlier [3]. Scott has also done past sci-fi movies including ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Alien’. This movie in particular he worked very closed with NASA to show a realistic view of space travel. NASA was very willing to help Scott in his journey to create the film which also follows their future vision of traveling to Mars (minus all the drama) [4]. NASA invited Scott to the Jet Propulsion Lab to give him a authentic view of tools such as the pathfinder. Scott wanted to display a realistic space movie and explore the pilots’ and astronauts’ fear, humor and confidence while on a mission [4].

    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>
        On the ethical side, each human life matters. Actually instead of ethical bottom line, “Bring Watney home” is more about saving a single human being who is in unexpected danger. Bringing a single astronaut home is also encouraging the rest of astronauts and researchers to feel being taken seriously and keep up high morale and motivation.
<br><br>
        On the economical side, taking the value of Mark Watney’s unexpected Mars survival experience into consideration, it will provide much more precious knowledge and information about Mars so that people can have a deeper understanding about Mars.
<br><br><br>
        Besides, the idea of assisting human astronauts with robots was proposed by NASA as early as 1997. An humanoid robot, Robonaut 1, was first developed. It has two robotic arms and could explore the plant surface under the instructions given by orbiting astronauts above. Its lower body can also be replaced to accommodate different use cases. A human shape was used so it can work operate the same devices used by astronauts. 
<br><br>
        Robonaut 2(R2) was released in 2010. This model added “two climbing manipulators, more capable processor and new sensors”.[2]  R2 is still continue being developed as of now.
<br><br>
        If the robonauts are more developed in the future, a lot of dangerous situations in the movie can be avoided. For example, the astronauts can stay in the spaceship while the robonauts go out for material collection tasks, then tragic at the start of the movie will not happen. Also, at the end of the movie, the robonaut can trigger the dynamite and also the crew members can control it to intercept Watney.
